## Airbnb_Price_Prediction_Berlin

# Background:
Machine learning is a ﬁeld of computer science that focuses on creating models that can predict patterns and relations among data. In this project, I use machine learning to predict Airbnb prices in Berlin to help the hosts in setting reasonable prices for their properties. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as linear regression  will be used to determine which model will provide the highest accuracy so that hosts set proﬁtable prices for their housing properties.

# Objectives:
The main goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to assist the hosts in setting reasonable rental prices for their properties so that they can keep their properties affordable for renters in Berlin and achieve maximun occupancy.

# Methods:
The dataset for Airbnb in European cities is gathered from insideairbnb.com and then has been pre-processed using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoder, standardscaler and principle component analysis. The data set is divided into three parts for training, validation and testing. Next, feature selection is done to determine the most important features that contribute to the pricing, and the dimensionality of the dataset is reduced. Supervised machine learning algorithms are utilized for training. 

# Streamlit Web Application:
Streamlit is designed to make the process of turning data scripts into shareable web apps as simple and straightforward as possible. It’s built on top of Python and leverages the power of modern web frameworks, allowing you to quickly prototype and deploy applications with minimal effort.
